BitNet + SNN: Progressive Quantization Results
==================================================

Progressive Ternary (600 neurons):
  PPL: 3.91
  Training: 981.5s
  Multiply: ZERO

Standard SNN (200 neurons):
  PPL: 1.60
  Training: 120.3s
  Multiply: Full FP32

PPL difference: +144.1%
Conclusion: 3x neurons with ternary ≈ standard quality
